                    While urgent care facilities are part of the solution,

                    care clinics that have popped up over the last few
                    years: The patient experience and administrative
                    workflows are not optimized. Patients are left waiting,
                    sometimes for hours, to be seen. At hospitals, where
                    the wait times are generally longer, patients are more
                    accepting of this. But when it comes to urgent care
                    centers, patients are less forgiving.

                    unpredictable wait times and no way to reliably

                    With the help of DrChrono EHR, Range has been able
                    to flip the traditional urgent care model on its head.
                    And the integrations compatible with DrChrono, help
                    facilitate this increased online presence and online
                    reputation.

                    Available integrations are able to send email or text
                    messages to patients as soon as that patient leaves
                    the practice. These messages prompt the patient
                    to easily review their experience. These integrations
                    reduce steps for doctors, since they don’t have to
                    reach out individually to patients, and bolster the
                    online presence of providers.

                    Range used DrChrono to design a clinic that has
                    the predictability of a favorite coffee shop with the
                    reliability and comfort of a spa. Patients had a more
                    satisfying experience. Staff spent less time charting,
                    and almost never had to take administrative work
                    home with them (although DrChrono for iPhone
                    makes that easy to do).

                    If you’re looking to avoid those business-breaking
                    negative web reviews, DrChrono can help you deliver
                    patient satisfaction on a customer-focused model.
                    The right EHR isn’t all it takes to start and run a highly
                    rated urgent care clinic, but it is a critical piece.
