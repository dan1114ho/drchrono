                    <div>
                        Dr. Zuri worked at All Podiatry Group (APG),
                        a long-established podiatry practice, which
                        had been seeing patients in Tampa, FL for
                        over 40 years. All Podiatry Group kept two
                        doctors busy with 40 patients a day across
                        two different offices. Unfortunately, because
                        APG had been established decades ago, they
                        were still using paper charts for all their patient
                        records.

                    <div>
                        Dr. Siegel, on the other hand, had recently left
                        a large practice in Chicago and started a new
                        practice in Tampa in 2017. Aptly named after
                        his mission to deliver modern patient care,
                        he built Modern Foot & Ankle with a strong IT
                        infrastructure and quickly amassed a
                        large clientele.

                <div class="mb-3">
                    Dr. Adam Siegel and Dr. Michael Zuri met during their
                    residency and developed a relationship that went
                    beyond friendship. When Dr. Siegel got married,
                    Dr. Zuri was his best man. So when they had an
                    opportunity to join forces and create a joint practice
                    together, they jumped on it.

                <h2 class="section-title mb-4">The Business Challenge</h2>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Seeing a merger as a way to realize their dream of
                    sharing a practice, Dr. Siegel and Dr. Zuri began
                    to discuss how they could join the two practices
                    together.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Having seen many other practices go through the
                    laborious transition from paper records to an EHR,
                    All Podiatry Group had avoided adopting an EHR
                    themselves. They had decided that the time and
                    headache they’d save from the EHR wasn’t worth the
                    downtime of transitioning all their records. APG had
                    just accepted the inefficiencies of paper records.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    But now that they would be merging their practices,
                    Dr. Siegel and Dr. Zuri quickly realized that choosing
                    the right EHR, one that would allow them to access
                    health records for multiple clinic locations and
                    accommodate workflows, would be essential for
                    creating a successful partnership.
                    This meant they would need to take the decades of
                    paper charts from All Podiatry Group and input them
                    into a modern EHR.
                </div>
                <h2 class="section-title mb-4">Solution</h2>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Dr. Siegel already had experience with DrChrono EHR
                    after choosing it for his practice when he established
                    Modern Foot & Ankle in 2017. He knew that it was
                    designed to work for one or many medical offices,
                    which made it a great fit for their merger. Once they
                    decided on DrChrono, it took less than two weeks
                    of downtime at All Podiatry Group to achieve full
                    adoption of the system. The results were immediate.
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Doctor Charting</div>
                <div>
                    DrChrono not only reduced the amount of time it took
                    for doctors to complete their patient charts during
                    a visit, but it also allowed them to interact more
                    closely with their patients. With access to the whole
                    EHR system via an iPad, doctors were able to make
                    eye contact with patients without needing to sit at a
                    computer.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    With common conditions and recommendations
                    prepopulated in the dashboard, doctors’ notes
                    became more detailed with less effort. Doctors were
                    also able to take before and after photos on the iPad,
                    logging them into the patient chart. Finally, because
                    billing profiles were integrated with the EHR, the
                    practice could immediately submit claims after visits
                    without extra coding, making the newly merged
                    practice more productive and efficient.
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Administration</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    With DrChrono, administrative staff was able to
                    spend far less time focused on repetitive tasks like
                    check-in, appointments, and phone calls. The userfriendly interface was easy to get the hang of
                    even
                    for staff members who were completely new to the
                    field. Erika, for example, worked at the front desk.
                    She had a background in the hospitality industry and
                    had no experience working as a medical admin, but
                    she picked up the new system as fast as the veteran
                    administrators.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Now that all patients were able to check-in at home
                    on their computers, it reduced wait times from half
                    an hour to a few minutes, allowing staff to spend
                    less time monitoring the waiting room. Scheduling
                    appointments were just as easy. Patients booked
                    a time online and were automatically reminded
                    with DrChrono’s text and email alerts. After a visit,
                    DrChrono followed up with patients and requested a
                    review, helping the newly merged practice build and
                    maintain their online presence and reputation.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    When an old patient came in, staff from All Podiatry
                    Group loved no longer needing to go into storage
                    to pull old patient charts; everything was uploaded
                    into the EHR. They also saved time checkingeach
                    patient’s insurance eligibility as this was also
                    automatically done for them. The fax machine
                    became a sort of joke because it sat there unused
                    once the team began using DrChrono’s
                    eFax integration.
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Bringing it All Together</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    In the process of the merger, Dr. Siegel learned
                    that All Podiatry Group had developed some
                    unique practices over its decades of operation.
                    They were worried that their new EHR might not be
                    customizable enough to accommodate APG’s unique
                    approach. However, they found that DrChrono gave
                    them tools to integrate many ways of doing things, all
                    of which they were able to integrate during their short
                    transition to the platform.
                    Now, the merged practice is 90% paperless and
                    the offices use digital tools such as Box to keep
                    an electronic paper trail for consents and receipts.
                    DrChrono’s unique blend of automation and
                    customizability has made their partnership greater
                    than the sum of its parts.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Case in point - the two practices are now poised
                    to scale their profitability. With many of the
                    previous processes that relied on manual work now
                    automated, onboarding new team members and
                    opening new offices is incredibly straightforward. And
                    with overhead and staffing costs are greatly reduced,
                    doctors and administrators can spend more time
                    caring for patients and less time caring for repetitive
                    tasks. Without sacrificing the quality of care, Dr.
                    Siegel and Dr. Zuri were able to cut time spent on
                    administrative tasks and see more patients than they
                    ever did before. As Dr. Siegel put it, “the name of the
                    practice is Modern Foot and Ankle, and I think the
                    way to make an office modern, is by having the most
                    up to date, the best technology available.”
