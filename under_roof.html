                    Stephanie and Matthew Trowbridge opened the
                    Range Urgent Care facility in Asheville, NC in 2017.
                    Long before the facility even treated its first patient,
                    the Trowbridges knew that they would need to devise
                    a unique business strategy to meet the evolving
                    needs of Asheville’s population.
                    Over 50% of Asheville’s population growth between
                    2010 and 2015 has been driven by people under
                    35, an audience with drastically different healthcare
                    expectations and preferences. This demographic is
                    tired of the traditional healthcare model - long wait
                    times, expensive copays, and sterile environments.
                    Seeing this as an opportunity, the Trowbridges
                    implemented online appointment scheduling, a flat
                    fee model,and a welcoming coffee shop aesthetic
                    in their clinic. Unsurprisingly, the Trowbridges were
                    able to cater to Asheville’s millennials better than any
                    other care facility in the region.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Of course, the story doesn’t end there. Despite
                    attracting new patients, the Range team still had to
                    tackle a litany of other challenges that come with
                    running an urgent care clinic like marketing, EMR,
                    reputation management, and billing just to name
                    a few. They were looking for a technology solution
                    that would give staff the bandwidth to consistently
                    provide a superior experience to patients. Indeed,
                    Range needed a comprehensive technology platform
                    that would manage all their practice’s needs. That
                    need led them to DrChrono.

                <div class="mb-3">
                    Because the Trowbridges were looking to really
                    modernize urgent care in Asheville, DrChrono
                    turned out to be a particularly good fit. DrChrono’s
                    comprehensive platform (with EHR, RCM,
                    scheduling, and billing, just to name a few) enabled
                    the Trowbridges to spend far less time on simple
                    and repetitive tasks, and far more on quality patient
                    care. The best part was that patients noticed and
                    appreciated the difference, starting from the moment
                    they checked in.
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">Appointments and Check-in</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    We got a chance to speak to Matthew Trowbridge
                    about the experience he and his team designed
                    for Range patients. “We have the iPad check-in
                    Kiosk where patients check-in to their scheduled
                    appointment or check-in for a walk-in appointment,”
                    Dr. Trowbridge said, “We don’t have a receptionist
                    so it’s a semi self-service. You walk in and interact
                    with the kiosk and our staff member comes in shortly
                    after.” Patients can book an appointment online and
                    see what wait times will be before they even arrive in
                    the clinic, giving them a sense of transparency and
                    control from the get-go. This allowed new patients to
                    immediately book appointments on Range’s website
                    after finding them, avoiding the delay, labor, and
                    possible loss of patients that comes from setting
                    appointments over the phone.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    By removing the receptionist, Range automated their
                    check-in and walk-in appointment booking workflows
                    and was able to get patients to providers sooner, a
                    huge boon for an urgent care facility. What’s more,
                    patients are able to easily book appointments online
                    and any new appointments immediately appear on
                    everyone’s calendar, so that all staff can prepare for
                    the day’s tasks.

                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">Payment Processing</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Instead of using a receptionist to process payments,
                    Range found an innovative solution. “We use Square
                    for payment processing and patients have been
                    very happy with it and it has been very streamlined
                    and easy to use... Basically whoever is taking care
                    of the patient will take the payment in the room and
                    it saves a lot of time and back and forth and is very
                    streamlined,” Dr. Trowbridge said. With this approach,

                <div class="mb-3">
                    Range was able to streamline payments, immediately
                    receiving funds while avoiding reconciliations and
                    human error. Furthermore, because providers
                    were able to process payments, it allowed them to
                    seamlessly attend to patients throughout their visit.
                    This gave patients more time in the exam room and
                    more time to ask questions, contributing to Range’s
                    coffeeshop-like experience in which the whole visit
                    feels relaxed and unrushed.
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">X-Rays, Lab Results, and Mobile Charting</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    X-rays and lab tests are common at urgent care
                    centers, but sharing results with patients is often
                    cumbersome, as it requires printing them or retrieving
                    them off isolated servers. “We’re able to have the
                    x-rays immediately accessible to every iPad in the
                    clinic,” Dr. Trowbridge said, “so we’re able to mirror
                    what’s on the iPads onto the televisions in the rooms
                    to show patients.“
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    By granting staff and patients greater access to
                    x-rays and lab results, Range provided staff the
                    flexibility to view results with patients anywhere,
                    get quick second opinions, and decrease overall
                    treatment time. Furthermore, because doctors and
                    staff could chart and view results directly on their
                    iPads, they were able to interact with patients more
                    directly, facing them and making eye contact. When
                    providers don’t finish a clinical note in the treatment
                    room, they can dictate the rest of the note quickly in
                    another room.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    “Most of the charting is done by the time the patient
                    leaves the clinic and worst case it’s done by the end
                    of the shift,” Dr. Trowbridge said, “The majority of
                    the time the chart is completed within 30 minutes
                    of the patient leaving the clinic. Typically a provider
                    specifically will spend up to 5 minutes charting and
                    10 minutes or more of patient interaction.” At Range,
                    patients feel cared for when they notice that doctors
                    are focused and listening and doctors don’t have to
                    worry about whether they’ll complete their charts for
                    the day. In fact, providers at Range spend 50% less
                    time charting compared to the national average.
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">Prescriptions</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    It can often take doctors a long time to write a
                    prescription and patients don’t always know which
                    pharmacy is most convenient form them. Using
                    DrChrono, Range could choose from common
                    prescriptions with pre-populated patient instructions.
                    To find a pharmacy, Range uses the DrChrono map
                    that shows the pharmacies closest to the clinic or any
                    address.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Furthermore, because of DrChrono’s simple,
                    integrated platform, doctors can look at unfilled
                    prescriptions or refill requests in between visits,
                    view charts, and complete tasks before they even
                    see their next patient. All this shaves time spent on
                    administrative tasks, allowing doctors to focus on
                    quality care for more patients.

                    Patient Claim Submission and Coding
                    Instead of hiring someone full time to manage
                    billing and coding, the Trowbridges found a clever
                    replacement - their x-ray technicians. In addition
                    to their main role, they “do most of the billing and
                    get a lot of use out of the live claims feed and ERA
                    section,” Dr. Trowbridge said.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    With the simple interface of DrChrono’s billing
                    software and its unified design, Range was able to
                    quickly teach x-ray techs to submit and monitor
                    claims. This approach also reduced hold times
                    because it was easy for any team member to quickly
                    check the status of any claim in DrChrono without
                    the need to transfer a call to a billing department.
                    Patients in turn also felt more comfortable because
                    they knew that Range was following up on their
                    claim. Today, Range has submitted close to 80%
                    of its appointments for reimbursement on behalf of
                    patients and has achieved an average clean claim
                    rate of 94.34%.

                <div class="mb-3">
                    Using DrChrono, Range Urgent Care has been able
                    to disrupt the way people get healthcare in Asheville.
                    Their unique, experience-focused approach has
                    led to glowing reviews, repeat visits, and a high
                    volume of patients. Without sacrificing the quality of
                    care, the Trowbridges were able to cut time spent
                    on administrative tasks and see more patients than
                    comparable practices. As one Yelp reviewer put it,
                    “Easy online appt reservations and in my case, no
                    wait time once I entered the facility… the folks here
                    give care and show compassion at a time when you
                    really need that kind of attention. Range will become
