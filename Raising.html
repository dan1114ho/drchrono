          “When your EHR doesn’t work, you don’t have time to get to know people. You spend less quality time with your
          family. You
          spend less quality time with your staff. You spend less quality time with your patients. This impacts the
          quality and
          efficiency of the work performed, and takes away from the joys of life.”
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph mb-2">
          Dr. Ratush and Dr. Jospitre completed residency together and went on to successful individual careers. Years
          later, they
          came together with the vision of creating a new standard of mental health for a larger number of patients.
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph mb-2">
          This led to their founding of SohoMD.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        Dr. Jospitre and Dr. Ratush began their practice using a psychiatry-specific EHR. Initially, their EHR seemed
        to fit their
        needs in mental health services, but they soon began to realize their practice had outgrown their first EHR. It
        could not
        meet their needs beyond the narrow scope of mental health services. In addition, the EHR provider was slow to
        innovate
        or update their software.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        Technology in psychiatric medicine was moving very fast and their EHR was not allowing them to advance in a way
        that they
        could stay up to date with their standard of care. Promised features or product updates did not materialize,
        and SohoMD
        felt stuck in its workflow, interaction with patients, and provider experience. Once they began seeing their
        growth impaired
        they knew they needed an alternative solution.
      </div>
      <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">The Solution</div>
      <div>When it came to finding a new EHR for their practice, SohoMD knew what they needed and for what purpose.</div>
      <div class="list-section">
        <div>They needed an EHR that: </div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <div>Drove efficiency and was easy to learn for new providers and staff</div>
          </li>
          <li>

            <div>Allowed integrations with third party health care solutions through API</div>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">After thorough research and investigation, they found DrChrono EHR.</div>
      <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Usability and Efficiency</div>
      <div class="text-primary font-italic mb-3">
        “Usability was important because no matter how great a feature might be if my staff cannot figure it out, the
        feature might
        as well not exist. DrChrono EHR was incredibly intuitive and we got our entire practice onboard very quickly.”
        - Dr. Jospitre
      </div>
      <div>Onboarding</div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        For SohoMD, being a practice with 13 providers meant that they needed an EHR that could be operated by people
        with diverging
        familiarity with using technology and did not require a complex onboarding process. Overall their transition to
        DrChrono
        EHR platform went smoothly, with some providers grasping the software with little to no necessary training, yet
        having
        access to a dedicated implementation specialist when questions arose.
      </div>
      <div class="sub-title mb-2">Clinical Efficiency</div>
      <div class="sub-paragraph mb-3">
        Customizable workflows and forms allowed Dr. Jospitre and Dr. Ratush to create the practice they had
        envisioned. Appointment
        statuses were tailored so they could track every step of the appointment and give the patient and doctor
        insight into what
        steps were next. Given multiple providers may have to provide the initial evaluation, having a flexible system
        that can
        be customized to fit their unique needs was critical in providing a comprehensive service. As for the clinical
        sessions
        or treatments, SohoMD worked with DrChrono to add shortcuts, such as smart switches. These shortcuts could
        automatically
        fill in notes with the flick of a switch and populate different questions accounting for different scenarios.
        DrChrono
        also helped SohoMD develop smart reports to flag patients who had not scheduled follow-up appointments and
        manage their
        patient population.

        <div class="col-md-6">
          <div class="sub-paragraph">
            One of the features that stands out is the ability to electronically prescribe substances and other
            medications in a safe
            and secure manner anywhere using iPad, iPhone or web. Given that Psychopharmacology is a central service
            SohoMD provides,
            they knew that to help patients manage their medications they would need to be able to monitor medication
            compliance, while
            also avoiding dangerous drug interactions. The two-factor authentication and ability to track medication
            history allowed
            SohoMD to continue to help patients while monitoring and managing the meds to keep their use at a healthy
            level. The drug
            interaction feature was also able to alert doctors of any possibly dangerous medication combinations.

        “Over 70% of physicians spend over 10 hours a week on administrative tasks”
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        DrChrono helped SohoMD tackle the top contributors of physician burnout, such as charting, paperwork, hours
        spent at work,
        and computerization of practice. With DrChrono the majority of SohoMD’s charting and paperwork was reduced to
        create a
        virtually paperless practice. The DrChrono platform offers the solutions that make it easier for providers to
        get their
        work done in the clinic so they don’t have to stay late or bring work home. The results showed in their
        provider retention
        -- their ability to reduce provider burnout allowed them to grow from 13 providers to 47 in the last 18 months.

      <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">
        Scalable Platform that Grows with the Practice
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        SohoMD needed to scale quickly to be able to meet their mission to expand access to mental health. As they
        continued to add
        providers both in the office and virtually, they needed an EHR that was replicable across multiple clinic
        setups to handle
        the growth, while streamlining administrative tasks through automation. The ability to automate enabled SohoMD
        to create
        consistency across multiple locations within the business practice. Integrated billing software within DrChrono
        EHR platform
        allows their in-house billers to be able to process a larger number of claims in a timely manner without the
        need to spend
        additional time coding repetitive claims.
      </div>
      <div class="list-section mb-3">
        <div>Some of the features that allowed scalability by eliminating the need for staff involvement:</div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <div>Automated email, phone, and text reminders</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div>Missing follow-ups reports</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div>Tasks flexibly assigned for outreach and follow-ups</div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <div>Integrated scheduling, outcomes assessments, reputation management, satisfaction surveys, and more.</div>

            <div>Patient portal</div>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        More often than not, mental health patients required active communication, and OnPatient, DrChrono’s patient
        portal, enabled
        SohoMD to get a direct connection to patients. The portal allows patients to communicate directly with
        providers and staff
        while maintaining HIPAA compliance. In addition, OnPatient also allows for patient payments online,
        streamlining patient
        collections to give staff more time for other priority tasks.
      </div>
      <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-2">Open API + Mobility = More Patients, Better Care</div>
      <div class="text-primary font-italic mb-3">
        “(DrChrono) has a great ecosystem, where other companies can make complementary solutions that integrate into
        the EHR. “
      </div>
      <div class="font-italic">Telehealth</div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        SohoMD’s desire and ability to conduct virtual medical services required a platform that supported easy
        integration with
        third-party telemed solutions. DrChrono’s open and robust API ended up being a large factor in their decision
        to pick DrChrono.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        Through telehealth, SohoMD is able to see patients who would otherwise not have access to their type of
        services in general.
        What's best is that this care can be given to patients using any device available to them, phone, iPad, or web.
        Patients
        have direct access to their providers when they need it, wherever they may need it.
      </div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        Besides provider retention, an increase in patient volume created growth that was closely linked to their
        ability to conduct
        telehealth appointments supported by automated processes. The number of virtual sessions held goes above 100 a
        week. Additionally,
        the number of monthly visits has more than doubled, which is made possible by automated follow-up process that
        facilitates
        patient adherence to treatment and ensures continuous patient visits. Providers are now able to provide
        services to more
        patients without sacrificing quality of care.
      </div>
      <div class="font-italic">Easy Integration with Apps</div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        SohoMD also explored DrChrono’s extensive list of partners and were able to discover an emerging technology at
        the forefront
        of the Psychiatry field, such as testing to find medication that works with a patients genetics. They
        integrated with several
        specialized apps and solutions, making them one of the most prepared and efficiently run practices ready to
        tackle the
        needs of a modern psychiatry practice.
      </div>
      <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">Conclusion</div>
      <div class="mb-3">
        SohoMD has achieved a lot in the last 18 months. Their use of DrChrono EHR, mobile solutions, and open API has
        equipped their
        practice to be positioned in a place where they can provide a higher standard of mental health care for a large
        number
        of patients.
