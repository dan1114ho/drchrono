            Jim Griffin is the President and COO of
            Direct Orthopedic Care (DOC), a multi-state
            orthopedic immediate access clinic. He
            joined DOC in 2016, spearheading DOC’s
            formation into a national practice group. The
            practice group is staffed with board-certified
            orthopedic surgeons and specialty-trained
            physician assistants across 9 locations in
            Dallas Fort Worth, Austin, and Southern
            California.

            Direct Orthopedic Care, or DOC, is a walkin clinic for referral-free, immediate-access
            orthopedic care. They want to revolutionize
            orthopedic care by giving patients an
            “instant care” alternative to the emergency
            room or an orthopedic specialist. In the next
            12 months, DOC is planning on expanding
            with 16 more offices.

        <h2 class="section-title mb-5">The Business Challenge</h2>
        <div class="paragraph mb-2">
          DOC had a mission: Provide immediate specialty orthopedic care with a focus on the patient experience.
        </div>
        <div class="list-section no-background mb-2">
          <div>In some ways, they were succeeding. They had already raised the bar by:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <div>Extending their operating hours and staying open 7 days a week</div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>Placing their locations in convenient, high-traffic areas (next to coffee shops and grocery stores,
                rather than middle-of-nowhere healthcare plazas)</div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>Cutting out the “middleman” referral process</div>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph mb-4">
          There was one problem that impacted every aspect
          of the business: the EHR system was getting in the
          way. Their initial EHR system negatively impacted
          and bottle-necked the experience from check-in to
          locked notes. This detrimentally affected the patient
          experience and the provider and staff experience at
          DOC.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">The Problems with Their Prior EHR System</div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          Their EHR system was old and complemented by a
          gigantic paper binder filled with hundreds of pages
          of clinical workflows and documentation. It had no
          room for integration with tools that would benefit
          the practice.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">Each new service DOC used required hours of manual work</div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          Reminder systems, analytics, scheduling--these processes required manual operation.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          Providers would almost always be taking paperwork
          home to finish the documentation on the day’s
          patients. DOC’s already-extended hours of operation
          made this post-hour work especially taxing.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Checking in patients greatly delayed the patient
          appointment</div>
        <div class="list-section mb-5">
          <div>It required additional manual effort to:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <div>Collect the necessary documents for signing</div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>Transfer the physical documents from checkin to the provider for review (prior to seeing the
                patient)</div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>And finally, re-enter the information into the EHR</div>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Patients felt the inefficiency of the EHR too</div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          The patient experience is impacted by having to
          fill out physical paperwork in the waiting room
          (especially as so much of their experience, even filing
          taxes, is now digital).
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          To top it all off, the patient is interacting with a
          provider and staff that are likely burnt out from the
          tedious, unending daily workload.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          The issues were apparent, and DOC knew there had
          to be a better way…
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">The Solution</div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          DOC knew most of their problems could be fixed by
          going digital, but they needed to keep operational
          costs affordable and wanted an EHR powerful
          enough to make the lives of providers and staffs
          easier while streamlining the patient experience. A tall
          order.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          DOC needed an easy-to-use, affordable, high-quality,
          100% paperless EHR solution.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          They found it in DrChrono.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Performance-Enhancing Improvement for Providers and Staf</div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          With DrChrono, DOC was able to completely digitize
          their intake process, reducing their intake time by
          68%.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          Then, DOC was able to reduce their workload
          substantially, to the point where all staff members
          were able to finish all of their notes before leaving the
          practice premises. They jumped from “guaranteed to
          take documentation work home”, to a 96% same-day
          locked note rate with most notes signed and locked
          within 30 minutes of clinic closing.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          DrChrono EHR cut DOC’s documentation time
          by 28%. Providers could finish their digital
          documentation as they finish seeing their patient.
        </div>
        <div class="list-section mb-4">
          <div>This had two big impacts:</div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <div>Documentation finished at point-of-care yielded more accurate documentation</div>
            </li>
            <li>
              <div>
                Employee satisfaction increased because providers
                and staff had a more manageable workload when
                working through the DrChrono EHR
              </div>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          As an extra bonus, DrChrono reduced DOC’s training
          time by at least 75%. DrChrono is intuitive and easy
          to use; new team members at DOC could pick up the
          EHR and intuitively navigate the workflow with little
          outside instruction. DOC has also seen a dramatic
          decrease in provider calls to the help desk.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">A Noticeable Boost to the Patient Experience</div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          The improved employee satisfaction bleeds into the
          patient experience. Patients are experiencing more
          satisfied staff and providers, making for a more
          pleasant encounter.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          DrChrono improves the experience in other ways,
          too: When patients arrive, they’re no longer tasked
          with filling out paperwork. Instead, they’re using
          iPads to check-in. Patients also have the ease of
          online scheduling.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          And from an aesthetic standpoint, they see a wireless
          office instead of an office cluttered with papers,
          gigantic binders, and wired desktop computers.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">A Highly-Affordable EHR Solution</div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          For their “retail” model to work, DOC needed an affordable total cost of ownership.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          Prior to using DrChrono, DOC subscribed to a Transcription service.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          Once they switched to DrChrono, they were able
          to cancel that service and use the savings to pay
          for their entire DrChrono subscription. DOC had a
          minimal change in cost and a maximal change in
          workflow and staff and patient experience. DOC saw
          their ROI within months of implementation.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Conclusion</div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          With the help of DrChrono, DOC is facilitating major changes in orthopedic care.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          They’ve succeeded in implementing their vision of
          non-referral, immediate-access orthopedic care,
          and they found an EHR that lets them streamline the
          clinical process from check-in to locked notes. And
          they did it while keeping their total cost of ownership
          lower than any other system they’ve evaluated.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          Aside from being the best choice for a high-quality,
          low-cost EHR system, DrChrono scales as needed.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          Even as DOC continues to expand, they have no
          plans of switching to a new EHR system.
        </div>
        <div class="text-primary font-italic mb-3">
          “When we switched to DrChrono, we knew this was
          going to be our last switch because we’re planning on
          becoming the largest orthopedic provider in the US,
          and we know that the platform is built for the future.”
