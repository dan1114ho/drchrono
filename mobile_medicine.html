                    In 2011, Bob Rahmanian, DO and Jim Liu, MD met
                    while working at the Physicians Regional Medical
                    System in Naples, Florida. Dr. Rahamanian and
                    Dr. Liu bonded quickly over their shared belief that
                    the latest mobility technologies, telemedicine, and
                    interoperability could offer much more to healthcare.
                    As they shared ideas, the two doctors saw that they
                    could realize their vision by starting a technologypowered practice together.

                        populations as their mission, Dr. Rahamanian and
                        Dr. Liu founded Zumedic in 2016. Now they run
                        a successful and fast-growing post-acute care
                        practice seeing patients in skilled nursing facilities
                        in the Naples and Fort Myers region. But it wasn’t
                        easy. When they started Zumedic, Dr. Liu and Dr.
                        Rahmanian faced some of the biggest challenges in
                        mobile care:

                <div class="mb-3">
                    With providers visiting patients all across the region,
                    Zumedic needed to prioritize patients’ needs while
                    coordinating providers’ schedules and travel. This
                    coordination was a full-time job all on its own.
                    Because Zumedic provides care for assisted living
                    facilities, they needed to develop and maintain
                    relationships with these institutions in order to earn
                    a consistent patient volume. Furthermore, many
                    of these institutions had strict requirements, which
                    would mean far more time spent on paperwork for
                    each patient in order to prove compliance. Finally,
                    as a mobile practice, providers had to be on site to
                    see their patients, so appointments needed to be
                    scheduled to maximize the number of patients they
                    could see and minimize the time they spent on
                    the road.

                    Having to partner with many different care facilities,
                    Zumedic needed a way to consolidate and interpret
                    all of the disparate information they were receiving.
                    This meant organizing and exchanging documents from not only living facilities, but hospitals, and
                    family
                    members as well.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Zumedic also had to find a way to schedule patients
                    in the most efficient way possible, which was more
                    difficult than it sounded. As a mobile practice
                    serving a vulnerable population, Zumedic needed
                    to prioritize the patients with the highest need while
                    minimizing the provider travel distance and time.
                    They also needed to ensure that they continued to
                    follow up with all patients to help address problems
                    before they required hospitalization. For most mobile
                    practices, this type of care coordination is a full-time
                    job. Often, new mobile practices tend to undervalue
                    the importance of this level of care coordination,
                    but Zumedic knew how essential efficient care
                    coordination would be to their success.

                    As they grew, Zumedic saw that effective
                    communication and coordination were essential
                    to their success. Knowing this, they sought a
                    comprehensive technology platform that would
                    integrate clinical and administrative tasks under
                    one roof. They found that DrChrono provided
                    everything they needed to manage their practice.
                    Take DrChrono’s e-fax and eRx integrations as an
                    example. Instead of printing reams of faxes and
                    requests for prescriptions at their command center,
                    Zumedic providers were able to communicate within
                    the platform and manage prescriptions, all in the
                    field.

                    DrChrono helped Zumedic stay in contact with their

                    track direct communication with patients and their
                    family members. All of this made providers’ lives
                    easier while maximizing turnaround times and patient satisfaction. Most importantly, providers had
                    constant
                    and immediate access to all clinically relevant
                    information, empowering them to make the most
                    informed care decisions.

                    Having to care for mobility challenged patients on
                    site was a problem that they saw in their field, the
                    Zumedic team knew that a key to patient outreach
                    would be establishing partnerships with local care
                    facilities. With many senior patients in the region,
                    forming even a handful of partnerships gave them
                    consistent appointment volume. However, with these
                    partnerships came strict standards for care. Zumedic
                    had to demonstrate their HIPAA compliance, quality
                    of care, coordination, follow-up, and accessibility.
                    DrChrono enabled Zumedic to definitively show their
                    adherence to all these standards and their superior
                    quality of care. Zumedic’s command center had
                    faster response times than competitors and allowed
                    patients to contact providers directly. Moreover,
                    Zumedic used DrChrono to create custom medical
                    forms for each partner that demonstrated their
                    comprehensive quality care and commitment

                    Many of Zumedic’s care facility partners expected
                    to have visit summaries by the end of the day. Using
                    DrChrono’s charts with smart switches, specialty
                    forms, integrated labs and eRx, Zumedic’s providers
                    are able to spend more time in front of patients and
                    minimal time doing paperwork. This also allowed
                    them to maximize the number of patients they saw
                    while boosting patient satisfaction.

                    Most providers spend around 60% of their time doing
                    administrative tasks. Zumedic’s providers, on the
                    other hand, only spend around 30% of their time on
                    administration thanks to built in shortcuts and smart
                    forms. This allowed their team a wonderful work-life
                    balance where work days were never more than ten
                    hours. Because all charting could be finished on site,
                    providers didn’t have to take work home unless they
                    wanted to.

                <div class="mb-3">
                    Historically, mobile care is one of the most difficult
                    practice formats in healthcare. Using technology,
                    Zumedic was able to rise to the occasion and is
                    now growing at a rate of 40% annually. Today, after
                    only two years, Zumedic partners with more than
                    17 facilities throughout their region, treating one of
                    society’s most vulnerable populations in a field where
                    most competitors before them had failed.
