                            When choosing the right Medical Billing platform, a main factor to consider is
                            practicality. Since
                            Medical Billing involves claim submission, staff and billers need access to patient records
                            for
                            accuracy. This means being connected to an EHR platform that documents all patient and exam
                            details. A sensible Medical Billing solution is fully integrated with an Electronic Health
                            Records
                            (EHR) platform, practice management system, and designated clearinghouse(s). Say goodbye to
                            third-party integrations and have complete access to an all-in-one powerful interface.

                            A clean claim starts before patients show up for their appointment. Medical Billing
                            platforms
                            should proactively lower no-show rates and cancellations. This includes requiring patient
                            details
                            and performing insurance eligibility checks pre-appointment to make sure your practice gets
