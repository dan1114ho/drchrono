          <div>
            Dr. Nadeem N. Vaidya is an ophthalmologist
            and surgeon who specializes in the retina
            and vitreous. The founder of Retina Orange
            County, a private practice in Irvine, CA,
            Dr. Vaidya also sees patients at Kaiser
            Permanente in Riverside. Dr. Vaidya
            graduated from Harvard with high honors and
            earned his MD from Tufts Medical School.

          <div>
            Dr. Vaidya established Retina OC in 2012
            as one of only ~1,500 retina subspecialists
            in the US. With only a few other retina
            subspecialists in the region, Dr. Vaidya quickly
            grew his practice from the ground up to
            treat over 2000 patients with four rotating
            staff members. Now he is one of the most
            respected retina and vitreous specialists in
            the state.

      <div class="section-row mb-2">
        <h2 class="section-title mb-4">Dr. Vaidya's Business Challenge</h2>
        <div class="mb-3">
          In his early days as an associate in New York, Dr.
          Vaidya collaborated with a team of doctors working
          in offices scattered throughout the boroughs. At
          that time, all patient records were kept in physical
          form. This meant that Dr. Vaidya and his staff
          had to constantly plan ahead to make sure that
          they retrieved patients’ charts from the clinic
          where they were filed before a visit. This wasn’t
          just inconvenient, it was a confidentiality risk and
          would result in uninformed care decisions when
          last minute visits meant no access to a patient’s
          prior history.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-5">
          When Dr. Vaidya decided to start his own
          practice, he knew what to avoid in order to run
          an efficient practice that provided high quality
          care. Consequently, he chose to take ownership
          over all operations, from patient interaction to
          billing. In pursuit of setting up an independent
          ophthalmology practice, Dr. Vaidya reached out to
          an ophthalmologist who ran a blog about starting
          one’s own practice. He learned from that meeting
          that by getting the right practice management
          EHR and billing platform that fit his requirements,
          everything would fall into place.

        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Finding the Right Software</div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          When Dr. Vaidya decided to start his own
          practice, he knew what to avoid in order to run
          an efficient practice that provided high quality
          care. Consequently, he chose to take ownership
          over all operations, from patient interaction to
          billing. In pursuit of setting up an independent

          everything would fall into place.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          Now, with DrChrono running all his practice’s
          administrative needs, Dr. Vaidya focuses on one
          patient at a time. He sees 15-20 patients a day,
          averaging around 20 minutes a visit. Dr.Vaidya
          estimates that he spends about five minutes of each
          consultation on his iPad charting and chatting with
          patients. His patients agree that they feel heard and
          cared for and that they appreciate his deft use of
          technology.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          With online check-in, digital eligibility checks, and a
          cloud-based EHR, neither Dr. Vaidya nor his patients’
          time is wasted. This keeps patients coming back.
          Even with back to back patient visits, technicians
          can complete necessary tests, upload the results
          to DrChrono, and send them straight to Dr. Vaidya’s
          iPad so that he has all the information he needs as
          soon as the visit begins.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Right Hardware</div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          Dr. Vaidyas’ workflow clearly demonstrates his
          passion for technology. He uses iPads at check-in.
          His digital ophthalmology tools store information
          securely in the DrChrono EHR. In the exam room,
          Apple TVs project patient information, facilitate
          education, and even conduct vision tests. These
          steps have put Dr. Vaidya ahead of the competition.
          He says the Apple hardware coupled with DrChrono
          EHR & billing software “makes it almost like child’s
          play, quick and easy, despite seeing around 20
          patients a day.”
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Self Managed Billing</div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          Billing has proven to be the area in which DrChrono
          has provided Dr. Vaidya’s practice the most value. If it
          weren’t for DrChrono, he would have to pay someone
          $60,000 a year to manage billing for the practice.
        </div>
        <div class="mb-4">
          Instead of hoping to get paid, he can watch individual
          claims get paid. The live claims feed allows him to
          view any claim status in real time and immediately
          follow up on denials or rejections. ERAs post into his
          electronic funds transfer so he never has to manually
          post EOBs.
        </div>
        <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Advanced Clinical Charting for Ophthalmology</div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          Dr. Vaidya has found that DrChrono offers
          comparative tools to ophthalmology-specific
          software. One feature he often uses is DrChrono’s
          draw tool. He can draw on a template retina in
          various colors, giving additional insight into a
          patient’s condition. This allows him to conduct and
          bill for extended ophthalmoscopies without carrying
          additional charting supplies. “If I do a lot of typing,”
          Dr. Vaidya says, “I have failed at customizing my
          template. [DrChrono] makes the repetitive things a lot
          easier.”
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          Using DrChrono’s text replacement, automation,
          and customizable templates, Dr. Vaidya is able
          to retrieve and input all the information he needs
          without wasting doctor-patient time. He can pull
          up his preferred prescriptions prepopulated with
          instructions, saving him time and assuring accuracy.
          And he can do this on any device. He once helped a
          patient with an emergency refill while watching a little
          league game.
        </div>
        <div class="list-section mb-2">
          <div class="text-primary text-center font-italic mb-3">
            “The typical ophthalmologist spent 3.7 hours
            using the EHR for a full day of clinic: 2.1 hours
            during examinations and 1.6 hours outside the
            clinic session”<sup>1</sup>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-3">
          Dr. Vaidya is happy these numbers do not apply to
          him or his practice with him spending on average
          just 30 minutes after the clinic hours. He spends the
          vast majority of his time in the room with patients,
          knowing that DrChrono will handle the rest.
          Technology and quality patient care are central to the
          success of Dr. Vaidya’s practice. With DrChrono’s
          powerful tools, Dr. Vaidya took control of his revenue
          and focused on what really mattered: patient health.
