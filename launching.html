                    The Range Urgent Care facility opened in
                    November 2017 in Asheville, NC. Range’s urgent
                    care center runs on a flat fee model and serves a
                    growing population in the most populous city of
                    Western North Carolina. Since then they have been
                    working to redefine what it means to run an urgent
                    care center.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    In 2017 the Trowbrige’s were faced with the
                    challenge of finding a way to provide a superior
                    patient experience and streamline all processes
                    associated with launching an urgent care clinic
                    while keeping cost in mind. Though starting up an
                    urgent care clinic can be a fulfilling experience, a
                    multitude of logistical and financial barriers can
                    muddle the entire undertaking. With the typical
                    startup cost hovering between $750,000 and $1.5
                    million, Range knew it was crucial to calculate
                    every move ahead of time and remove as many
                    hurdles as possible to pull off a flawless launch.
                </div>
                <h2 class="section-title mb-4 font-weight-bold">The Solution</h2>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    In order to have a successful launch for their first
                    clinic, Range needed to be proactive in developing
                    their systems and processes that fit their various
                    requirements. By using DrChrono’s mobile check-in
                    app and EHR on iPad and iPhone, Range streamlined
                    their practice management, in addition to enhancing
                    patient encounters. Specifically, using DrChrono
                    helped Range eliminate much of the operational
                    costs needed to run an efficient and profitable
                    practice, appeal to the millennials who make up a
                    significant portion of Range’s patient demographic
                    and help them stand out from the crowd with easy
                    appointment scheduling and more.
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">Savings on Operational Costs</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Thanks in large part to the automations provided by
                    DrChrono, Range was able to significantly cut back
                    on operational expenses like payroll. For example,
                    Range did not need a receptionist because they
                    implemented a check-in kiosk in the front to handle
                    walk-ins, online scheduling on their website for
                    appointments, as well as an integrated POS and
                    message center directly in the DrChrono applications.
                    This saved Range roughly $65,000 annually per
                    clinic.<sup>1</sup>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Range also did not need a biller or coder because of
                    DrChrono’s integrated claims management tool was
                    extremely easy to submit and manage claims. This
                    saved Range roughly $38,000 annually.<sup>2</sup>
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">Catering To a Core Demographic</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Range saw that Asheville was a good location to
                    open their first urgent care clinic. Asheville was
                    growing at a rate of 7.1% with over 50% of its
                    population growth coming from Millenials and
                    younger.3
                    Furthermore, millenials prefer the retail and
                    acute care clinics (34% and 25% respectively) at a
                    far higher degree than boomers (17% and 14%) and
                    seniors (15% and 11%).4
                    Much of this preference
                    is attributed to the perceived patient experience
                    which comes from expected speed of service, price
                    transparency, and online reviews. Nearly 50% of
                    Millennials and Gen-Xers use online reviews when
                    shopping for a healthcare provider.<sup>4</sup>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    With DrChrono, Range was able to appeal to
                    millennials and differentiate themselves as a
                    convenient, forward-thinking practice. Range minimized in-clinic wait times with online
                    appointment scheduling and a virtual queue system
                    with wait times and availability accessible online.
                    Upon scheduling, the system sends patients real-time
                    appointment updates via text messages, creating a
                    calmer, more convenient careplace for both staff and
                    patients. Today, 86% of Urgent Care clinics still do
                    not accept appointments. Of the 14% that do, 35%
                    of appointments were scheduled via phone and 48%
                    through the web.<sup>1</sup>
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    DrChrono also helped the Range team optimize their
                    day-to-day workflow from the check-in process to
                    triaging to charting to check-out facilitating a superior
                    experience for both the patient and staff.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Six months into operations, millennials make up
                    34% of Range’s overall patient population with an
                    additional 14% of visits being pediatric visits, most
                    of which come from millennial parents.5
                    Through
                    DrChrono, Range was also able to automate their
                    patient satisfaction surveys getting over 200 reviews
                    in the first quarter of operation, which allowed them
                    to proactively manage patient reviews. Almost 10%
                    of Range’s monthly visits are repeat patients.
                </div>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold">Conclusion</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Starting up a practice is a costly endeavor, both from
                    a financial and logistical standpoint. By integrating
                    DrChrono into their day-to-day operations, Range
                    has been able to make their start-up experience a
                    smooth one. Specifically, they have been able to
                    streamline processes, optimize productivity and
                    cut costs thanks in large part to the features and
                    functionality available through the DrChrono platform.
                    If you are looking to start your own urgent care clinic,
                    carefully consider how you want to run your practice
                    and how you want it to grow. The EHR/Practice
                    management platform you choose will be a critical
                    partner to your success.
