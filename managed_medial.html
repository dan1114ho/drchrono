                                hired a biller, who was an “expert”
                                in billing for chiropractic. After some
                                time, our client noticed that he had
                                an abundance of new patients and
                                appointments, but he was seeing very
                                little revenue from his billings. Since
                                our client was already a drchrono EHR
                                customer, he called drchrono for help.

                                success. He was immediately setup with a
                                team of billing specialists who overhauled
                                his billing practices...all at a lower cost than
                                what he was spending for his internal biller.
                                The results speak for themselves:
