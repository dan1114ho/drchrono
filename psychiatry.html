                        Brian O’Neill was getting his Registered
                        Nurse certification just before he decided to
                        start his own solo practice as a PMHNP in
                        Wyoming. Having started a practice in a rural
                        area, Brian O’Neill recognized that there were
                        not many psychiatrist in the area, and felt it
                        would be a great place for him to practice. He
                        now provides service for a number of mental
                        health disorders.

                        Founded in 2012, Beartooth Brainworks is
                        a private practice in rural Wyoming. Brian
                        O’ Neill serves 500-600 patients diagnosed
                        with a variety of mental health issues
                        including ADD/ADHD, sexual abuse trauma,
                        schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.

                <h2 class="section-title mb-4">The Business Challenge</h2>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Brian O’Neill became certified as PMHNP in
                    Wyoming before starting Beartooth Brainworks
                    in 2012. In his previous position at a hospital,
                    he was inundated in paperwork and battled a
                    poorly structured internal process. There almost
                    seemed to be “built-in inefficiencies,” he said,
                    like when things “could have been resolved in a
                    call, but nurses would still have the patient come
                    in.” Lamenting that there was “too much distance
                    between the provider and patient,” O’Neill set his
                    goal of “bridging the gap” to improve patient care.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-5">
                    When O’Neill decided to open up his own practice,
                    he knew that the first step to bridging the gap
                    between patient and provider would be to take
                    control of every aspect of his practice. As a solo
                    provider starting on his own, he needed a practice
                    management software that would not bog him
                    down with various administrative tasks, and help
                    keep his practice running efficiently. Soon after
                    opening his practice in 2012, O’Neill realized that
                    managing the backend tasks of his practice like
                    credentialing and enrollment were taking months
                    for him. He also had to catch up on billing at the
                    end of every week. Worst of all, these tasks were
                    getting in the way of quality patient care. That’s
                    when he turned to DrChrono’s RCM team for help
                </div>
                <h2 class="section-title mb-4">The Solution</h2>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    DrChrono’s all-in-one integrated EHR and Billing
                    Platform provided O’Neill with practice management
                    tools and advanced clinical charting features to
                    help manage everything from patient care to billing.
                    As for his billing challenges, O’Neill has partnered
                    with DrChrono’s RCM team who manages his entire
                    backend needs. Since then, his practice has been
                    able to maintain a higher net collections rate, and he
                    enjoys a great work-life balance. He has effectively
                    closed the gap between provider and patient,
                    and he’s happy to spend the majority of his work
                    hours visiting clients. He now enjoys the flexible
                    work schedule that rarely comes with running an
                    independent business, and is still able to make more
                    time for patients when they need him.

                <h2 class="text-dark font-weight-bold">How O’ Neill Set Up DrChrono To Run an Entirely Independent
                    Practice with No Staff Support</h2>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">Workflow Optimization</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    With customizable clinical forms and tools, DrChrono
                    EHR was an easy choice for Brian to integrate into his
                    practice. He has been able to utilize speech-to-text
                    and copy from previous notes, “because in psychiatry
                    there’s a lot of stuff that continues to flow through”.
                    At the end of the day, he spends minimal amounts of
                    time polishing his notes and wraps up his work.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-4">
                    Sending notes when needed was incredibly easy
                    and saved him lots of time wasted running back
                    and forth. Being in a field that deals with sensitive
                    circumstances, O’Neill has been in a few depositions.
                    “The notes fit all the requirements for the legal side
                    of what we need to do, and it’s been really nice,
                    how it’s set up it’s really easy for the attorneys to
                    go through which makes my life easy because then
                    they don’t have to do much questioning … easy for
                    them to read, easy for me to testify....”, the tools
                    available make it easier for him to help patients in
                    circumstances that many providers are not
                    familiar with.

                <div class="mb-3">
                    Other tools that help O’ Neill bridge the gap between
                    patient and provider are the secure messaging,
                    mobile EHR and e-prescribing features.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    Secure messaging enables him to work with patients outside of the office, allowing patients to
                    reach him at
                    any time which is particularly important for the types
                    of patients he treats, who commonly suffer from
                    anxiety or bipolar disorder.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    O’Neill has also been able to create a comfortable,
                    welcoming patient experience using only an iPad. He
                    simply sits down on the couch with the patient while
                    charting on his iPad, sometimes without the patient
                    even realizing it. The conversations flows naturally,
                    and feels not only personal, but also safe, which is
                    especially important for O’Neill’s patients.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    In addition, e-prescribing accessible by mobile
                    devices enhanced his patient care. From refill
                    requests to pharmacy lookup, he can even help
                    patients when they head out of town.

                        “One of the coolest things about
                        [e-prescribing] is say a patient goes and
                        travels, forgets their medication, they call
                        me from California... I say give me [the]
                        address… we go to search… 3 blocks
                        down, 2 blocks over, I sent your prescription
                        there, so you’re good to go. Boom.”

                </div>
                <div class="explanation-title font-weight-bold mb-3">“Hands Off” Billing Management</div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    For the first several months after starting his practice,
                    O’Neill had been managing his billing in-house,
                    which became increasingly difficult to maintain as his
                    practice began to take on more patients. Frustration
                    began to surface as he went through the certification
                    process. He did not have time to spend on menial
                    tasks, once he implemented RCM into his practice,
                    his problems were taken care of for him. In his own
                    words, “I was trying to get it done for three or four
                    months … I was like, these guys are the bomb, which
                    is fantastic because this was a freakin’ nightmare!”.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    The DrChrono RCM team implemented processes
                    that allowed him to submit claims with a fast
                    turnaround. In a matter of weeks, his billing cycle
                    had become fully implemented. O’Neill upgraded to
                    the DrChrono RCM plan to have the ability to see
                    more patients and provide higher quality care. His
                    billing performance compared to industry averages
                    reinforces his believe that DrChrono RCM was the
                    best decision for his practice.

                    patients anywhere around the world. With DrChrono’s
                    full featured mobile EHR, all he needs is his iPhone
                    or iPad and cell service. He is able to stay ahead of
                    his workload even as a solo provider because he can
                    access his patients’ medical record, document a full
                    patient encounter, sign off on it and lock the note
                    wherever he is. DrChrono’s RCM team then simply
                    bills right to the insurance company.

                    Since partnering with DrChrono nearly six years
                    ago, O’ Neill has barely had to make any changes
                    to his scheduling, charting, or billing profiles. His
                    encounters feel completely natural, his charting
                    is complete, and billing succeeds with hardly any
                    intervention on his part. By streamlining these internal
                    workflows he has succeeded in “bridging the gap”
                    between provider and patient, and offers quality
                    patient care he can be proud of. DrChrono EHR has
                    proven to be the virtually “hands-off” solution O’
                    Neill needed to manage his administrative and billing
                    work as a completely solo psychiatry practice, now
                    handling over 500 active patients spanning over three
                    locations with only a four day work week.
